We request that you email us a photograph of the plant so that we can send it to our plant experts to be reviewed. Bear in mind that plants look different depending on what time of year it is. If you choose deciduous shrub in the winter, it's going to turn up looking pretty bare. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it, just that it's out of season and will perk up when the weather does. Many perennial plants won't even show above the soil level in a pot during the winter. However, if you are concerned, contact us with a photograph of the plant within 14 days of delivery and we will be happy to pass the photographs to our plant experts to assess whether there is a problem."

If it fails in the 1 month, send us a picture of the plant along with your order reference number to customerservices@crocus.co.uk. Our plant experts will assess the photograph and identify the problem. This guarantee does not include any plants damaged due to lack of watering or lack of proper horticultural care, so plants will not be replaced if the care guidelines have not been followed. Also, because these are completely beyond our control, we cannot be responsible for any airborne pests and diseases such as box blight, fungal leaf spot or aphids."
